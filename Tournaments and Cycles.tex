\title{Tournaments and Cycles}

\maketitle

\section{Problem}
Prove that a tournament is intransitive if and only if it contains a directed cycle.

To solve this problem, I used what I learned from 4.8.2, 4.8.3, and 4.8.4. 

\section*{Problem 4.8.2}
\textit{How many tournaments are there with n teams?}
\\ \tab There are $2^{\frac{(n)(n-1)}{2}}$ tournaments that are possible for a tournament of n teams. 
This is because for every extra edge (represented by $\frac{(n)(n-1)}{2}$), there are 2 times the possibilties.

\section*{Problem 4.8.3}
\textit{Is the tournament in Figure 4.33 transitive or intransitive?}
The tournament in 4.33 is intransitive. A, D, and E all lose to one of their opponents, but beat the other.

\section*{Problem 4.8.4}
\textit{Give an example of a transitive tournament with five teams.}\\
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw(0.25,3.25) node {A};
\draw(2,-3.25) node {B};
\draw(-2,-3.25) node {C};
\draw(3.25,1) node {D};
\draw(-3.25,1) node {E};
\draw (0, 3) -- (2, -3);
\draw (0, 3) -- (-2, -3);
\draw (0, 3) -- (3, 1);
\draw (0, 3) -- (-3, 1);
\draw(2, -3) -- (3,1);
\draw(2, -3) -- (-3,1);
\draw(-2, -3) -- (3,1);
\draw(-2, -3) -- (-3,1);
\draw(-2, -3) -- (2, -3);
\draw(-3, 1) -- (3,1);
\end{tikzpicture}

\section*{Prove that a tournament is intransitive if and only if it contains a directed cycle.}
We know that any tournament with a directed cycle will have a 'loop' of points, which is how I will begin this proof.
\\
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw(1.25,1.25) node {A};
\draw(1.25,-1.25) node {B};
\draw(-1.25,1.25) node {C};
\draw(-1.25,-1.25) node {D};
\draw (1, 1) -- (1 ,-1);
\draw (1, 1) -- (-1, 1);
\draw (-1,-1) -- (1, -1);
\draw (-1,-1) -- (-1, 1);
\draw [->] (1, 1) -- (0,1);
\draw [->] (-1, 1) -- (-1, 0);
\draw [->] (-1,-1) -- (0, -1);
\draw [->] (1,-1) -- (1, 0);
\draw (0, -2) node {Fig. 1};
\end{tikzpicture} \\
In figure 1, we have begun to draw a tournament. However, we have to make it into a complete graph for us to count it as a tournament.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw(1.25,1.25) node {A};
\draw(1.25,-1.25) node {B};
\draw(-1.25,1.25) node {C};
\draw(-1.25,-1.25) node {D};
\draw (1, 1) -- (1 ,-1);
\draw (1, 1) -- (-1, 1);
\draw (-1,-1) -- (1, -1);
\draw (-1,-1) -- (-1, 1);
\draw [->] (1, 1) -- (0,1);
\draw [->] (-1, 1) -- (-1, 0);
\draw [->] (-1,-1) -- (0, -1);
\draw [->] (1,-1) -- (1, 0);
\draw [->] (-1,-1) -- (0,0);
\draw (-1,-1) -- (1,1);

\draw (0, -2) node {Fig. 2};

\draw(4.25,1.25) node {A'};
\draw(4.25,-1.25) node {B'};
\draw(2.25,1.25) node {C'};
\draw(2.25,-1.25) node {D'};
\draw (4, 1) -- (4 ,-1);
\draw (4, 1) -- (2, 1);
\draw (2,-1) -- (4, -1);
\draw (2,-1) -- (2, 1);
\draw [->] (4, 1) -- (3,1);
\draw [->] (2, 1) -- (2, 0);
\draw [->] (4,-1) -- (4, 0);
\draw [->] (2,-1) -- (3, -1);
\draw (4, 1) -- (2,-1);
\draw [->] (4, 1) -- (3,0);

\draw (3, -2) node {Fig. 3};
\end{tikzpicture}
\\
Here, we have drawn $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{A'D'}$. No matter which team we have win, we create a directed 3 cycle. This concept works for larger shapes as well. For a directed \textit{n} cycle, we can always connect two points which are adjacent to the same point. If we connect it with one result, we have created a directed 3 cycle. If we have to opposite team win, we have created a directed \textit{n-1} cycle, which we can then apply to same technique on. 

\section{Analysis}
This problem was very interesting, and tournaments have been a cool way to apply graph theory. I hope we will talk about brackets soon - they seem very interesting. 
\section{Status}
I feel like I understand this problem very well, and am excited to prove more cool things about tournaments. 
\section{MVP}
I have no MVP.
